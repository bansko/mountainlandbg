    "en": "This 16073 metreÂ² (3.97 acre) property consists of 8 plots. The largest (just under an acre) is zoned as \"Urban: for other construction\". Two plots are access routes connecting the property to two separate roads one of which is paved and regularly cleared of snow in winter. The remaining five plots are zoned as Agricultural. Three are designated as meadows and two as fields. The property is located in the Bansko ski zone and is situated on the boundary of the Pirin National Park. It is a 15 minute walk (550m) from the property to the Ski Gondola. It is currently impossible under zoning rules for any construction to interrupt the beautiful park view to the south."
